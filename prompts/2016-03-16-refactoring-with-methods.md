#What did you learn from the refactoring process? What did you see during the demo that you can do going forward? How did your approach differ from my approach? How were our approaches the same? If you were to do this again, how would you approach it?


I kept wanting to make everything as simple as possible but not always knowing how to do it. My goal is always to make whatever I do as efficient as I can but being new to this specific type of thinking makes that seem impossible. Once I finally got my code error free I started to feel excited but then apprehensive as I know it's not as concise as it *could* be. 

The demo illustrated to me that code can usually be refactored more than I think. But I also need to weigh refactoring process against how much time it's taking me to do it. There comes a point when refactoring just eats up other development time. 

My approach was very simplistic and compared to the demonstration didn't seem to refactor very much. I will keep trying.
