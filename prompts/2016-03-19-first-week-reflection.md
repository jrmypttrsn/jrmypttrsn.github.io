#What did you learn last week? Make a list? What things came hard? What do you still struggle with? How are you feeling? How are you doing?

**Things I learned**
* I can navigate Lincoln on a bike
* I enjoy yoga
* I can _actually_ learn how to program
* learning how to program will have a _lot_ of peaks and valleys
	* this will not stop me from trying
* this kind of work excites me more than I thought it would

Learning the syntax has been hard, but reading Chris Pine's book is already helping, even just reading just the first two chapters last night. The math part of some methods we worked with this week makes my brain hurt and I feel a bit of regret not taking more math courses when I could have.

At the moment, I'm feeling kind of neutral about everything, but that's mostly because I'm tired and the coffee has worn off. I had to keep reminding myself that all of this is new, that one day it'll all make sense. But it's hard when I don't know what I don't know and I have to write something from scratch. I am encouraged by the flow charts and having a way to visually represent what I need to do. That will be a big help.
